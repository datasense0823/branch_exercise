# Github Workshop: Branching Exercise

## Scenario

Imagine you're a developer at Hogwarts Tech, and your team is launching a new project called "Patronus". The project will serve as a fun repository where each branch represents the magical signature of different characters from the wizarding world. Your task is to set up the repository and create separate branches to represent the Patronus of Harry, Snape, and Lily. This exercise will help you master Git branching, enabling parallel development and isolated experimentation.

**Project Name:** Patronus

**Objective:** Manage different versions of a file (patronus.txt) that displays ASCII art for each character's Patronus.

**Characters & Branches:**

**1. Harry:** Represented on the harry branch, showcasing his stag Patronus.
**2. Snape:** Represented on the snape branch, featuring his doe Patronus.
**3. Lily:** Derived from Snape’s branch, but with a header change to reflect Lily’s Patronus on the lily branch.
