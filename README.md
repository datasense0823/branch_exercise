# Github Workshop: Branching Exercise

1. Create a folder named Patronus on your machine.
2. Make a new git repo inside the folder (make sure you're not in an existing repo)
3. Create a new file called `patronus.txt` (leave it empty for now)
4. Add and commit the empty file, with the message "add empty patronus file"
5. Immediately make a new branch called `harry` and another branch called `snape` (both based on the master branch)
6. Move to the `harry` branch using the "new" command to change branches.
7. In the patronus.txt file, add the following:

```
